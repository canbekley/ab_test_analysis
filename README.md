## Summary
A/B tests are very commonly performed in data analysis and in data science. For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test for an e-commerce website.  I created this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Prerequisite
### Files that are included:
<ul><li><code>ab_test_analysis.html</code> - the complete data analysis report</li>
  <li><code>ab_test_analysis.ipynb</code> - a JSON file, formatted for the usage in Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li><code>environment.yaml</code> - the environment containing the packages and their versions to be used with Anaconda</li>
  <li><code>requirements.txt</code> - all packages and their versions listed in a txt-file</li>
  <li><code>ab_data.csv</code> - the original dataset file</li>
  <li><code>countries.csv</code> - an additional dataset file</li></ul>

### Installation:
In order to run the project on <code>Anaconda</code>, you will need to download the files <code>ab_test_analysis.ipynb</code>, <code>environment.yaml</code>, <code>ab_data.csv</code>, and <code>countries.csv</code> and save them in the same directory. Next, you will have to navigate the <code>Anaconda Prompt</code> to the directory of the files. Create the environment using <code>conda env create -f environment.yaml</code> and activate it with <code>activate py3</code>. Now you can open the notebook by typing in <code>Jupyter Notebook</code> and run the IPYNB file from there.

### Without Installation:
You can just view the complete analysis and the used code from the included HTML file <code>ab_test_analysis.html</code> without any prerequisitions.
